==== External Call To User-Supplied Address ====
SWC ID: 107
Severity: Medium
Contract: Milkshake
Function name: get()
PC address: 359
Estimated Gas Usage: 6567 - 61228
A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
The callee address of an external message call can be set by the caller. Note that the callee can contain arbitrary code and may re-enter any function in this contract. Review the business logic carefully to prevent averse effects on the contract state.
