==== External Call To User-Supplied Address ====
SWC ID: 107
Severity: Medium
Contract: RaceCondition
Function name: buy(uint256)

Estimated Gas Usage: 14123 - 89960
A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
The callee address of an external message call can be set by the caller. Note that the callee can contain arbitrary code and may re-enter any function in this contract. Review the business logic carefully to prevent averse effects on the contract state.
